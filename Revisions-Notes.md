Don't completely start from scratch - copy little pieces from what you've used before.

Strategies for Revision - for Seeing it Differently:
1) See it Differently 
2) Paramedic Method
3) Read Aloud - presenting your complex tech work will help make it clear where thee are obscure, wordy, or misleading parts. 

Once you see a problem, formulate a plan to approach writing and improve it.

Approaching in a Systematic Way
1) Coming to Terms - understanding what it is that you have here. **Write an abstract** - look very carefully at each piece of your document and write an abstract of what is there. **Reverse Outlining** - take finished draft and write an outline of it. Don't write abstract before writing the paper.
2) Forwarding - Building on the strength of your document - things you're doing well, do more of them if you possibly can.
3) Countering - Doing critical work - understanding where there are problems and what you can do with them. **Finding gaps** - things that you left out. 
4) Looking Ahead - Final call to action, others idea you want them to investigate, what are the steps you want your audience to take? what else is there to say about this topic? What other work might you want to do? Something else that could be done?
