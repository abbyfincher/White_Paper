### Linkage to Resource

[Grizzly Bears are Cool BTW](https://blog.nature.org/science/2016/10/19/follow-grizzly-understanding-bear-movements-northwest/)
- written in 2016 - research done in 2015

(NOTE: will probably not use this as my topic - just for today's participation - but I may change my mind, so...doors open).

### What About

Grizzly bear movement over a range to see patterns and preferred area, such as territory and home range. The bear in the study had a radio collar so biologists could see her movements over a period of time and determine where she went, how long she stayed, and perhaps what she was doing there. This study happened between Montana and Canada. This research was done in the attempt of grizzly bear recovery efforts in the NW.
