## Use of Images
- Precise: Level of depth of image should be equivalent to level of depth in your text - Should not be more complex than your text
- Clear: Images cannot stand alone - caption image - don't assume (you know what they say about assumimng...)
- Fluid: Transitioning between illustration to text - use terminology consistantly - position image appropriately so reader's eye hits it where it's relevant. Need text first, then hit the image - provide sufficient white space to let reader smoothly process everything and not feel like everything is crowded
- Familiar: Consider what audience already knows and make sure image choices are not presuming what audience already knows - Scale. make sure image makes that clear to someone who may have never seen something like this before. 

## Other Info Stuff
- Pull quotes - small box on page that pulls important quote from the text - strongly consider if writing for less expert audience that needs more help to stay intersted in the topic.
