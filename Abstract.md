## Investigation

I am investigating bear movements and how they interact with the human population. This will be informative for the public as it will help them stay safe when outdoors in grizzly and black bear territory. Knowing bear movement patterns, when they move the most, where they are most likely to be, and what causes these movements helps outdoorsmen stay safe in bear environments and home ranges. Knowing the most likely places bears will be depending on time of year will aid hikers and backpackers on their search for outdoor recreation and be at peace with the nature that surrounds them. 

These sources will aid me in my research as they are directed toward bear movements depending on the factors stated in the previous paragraph. Bears are interesting and underestimated regarding how much and how far they move within a given season and in what human-traffic areas they are most likely to be. Bears are cool.
