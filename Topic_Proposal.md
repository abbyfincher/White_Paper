## Topic Proposal - White Paper

For this assignment, I am researching bear movement patterns and interpreting the information for backpackers and/or serious hikers/campers - people who would have an extremely high chance of encountering wild bears while outdoors. The research is mostly set in Wyoming, Montana, and Canada, and will provide insight to grizzly bear movement across their territory, which would include some human traffic areas. Knowing where bears are moving, how often, when they move the most, why they move, and understanding their movement patterns will help keep serious backpackers and hikers safer when moving through bear territory.
