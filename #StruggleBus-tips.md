## #StruggleBus Tips
1) Long and challenging project - try to work on it every day - even if its only 10 or 15 minutes - more effective than long hours of writing...A little bit at a time.
2) Don't stop at the end of a section, but write yourself into the next section, so you have a little bit of momentum when you pick it up again. 
3) Ask for a model (example or sample). 
4) Use of tools - make sure you don't have to spend a lot of extra time finding something you wrote down that you didn't keep track of or going back and looking for your sources. Zotero - stores sources - exports in whatever citation style you use and keeps notes in there - manage research notes. Brain extenders. Labotomy! - Another tool is version control (records every change you make so you can safely delete a whole section so if you want to use that again, it is still accessible).
5) Use of placeholders to say you want to place somthing here then keep moving - like a data point. Write something like DATA POINT or PARAGRAPH ON SUCH AND SUCH HERE so you can keep your momentum and not get yourself distracted. 
6) Don't get too much feedback or become too dependent on others looking at your writing. Be very specific about what kind of feedback you're looking for. One layer of feedback at a time if you can.
