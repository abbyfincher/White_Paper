# GRIZZLY BEARS
# THEIR TERRITORY, YOUR DUTY
## Safety During the Hiking High

Backpacking has become an increasingly popular hobby for outdoor enthusiasts. These serious hikers know about wildlife and how to stay safe when in their territory, but knowing specifically when more predacious wildlife, grizzly bears in particular, are moving around more frequently in their territory could help with safety while enjoying the great outdoors. There are a lot of factors that play into why grizzly bears start moving around their territory a lot more, and all of them are important to consider when planning a backpacking or day hike. Being caught between a grizzly and their territory can be dangerous. 

## BEARS EVERYWHERE!

Why do bears move so often during certain times of the year? Well, when grizzly bears first come out of hibernation, they are starving. The first thing they want is a good meal, so they go searching for whatever they can find in order to begin taking in a massive amount of calories before winter comes once again (PUT IN SOURCE HERE). Grizzlies are moving the most in spring and into the summer. Mating season, which occurs between mid-May and late June, also plays a huge role into this (SOURCE). When males begin moving around looking for a female, the danger level for humans in grizzly territory goes up. This can be a bad time to be out and about while in a grizzly’s home range.

Trying to plan a trip around the time when bears move is important. Knowing where they traffic the most is extremely helpful as well. There are multiple studies working with GPS that monitored and tracked grizzly bears, mapping out where they went and how far they traveled (SOURCE). INPUT DATA FROM STUDY HERE. Bears move around much more than we give them credit for. Their home range is huge because they are a large animal. The larger the animal, the larger the home range for that animal.

## HOW DO YOU AVOID GRIZZLY BEARS?

Avoiding grizzlies seems easier said than done, however, encountering a grizzly bear while backpacking is extremely high, especially depending on the location of your voyage. Knowing exactly where grizzly bears are most likely to be will help you avoid running into them. During the spring and summer, salmon run the waterways in the northwest, and many grizzly bears are likely to be in the rivers and streams catching their fill of fish. In this case, avoid waterways and choose a more mountainous route. Obtain the latest data from the local fish and wildlife service and keep track of common bear corridors and travel-ways. This combination of knowledge will help you stay safe when out on the trails. INSERT DATA POINTS AND REFERENCES

## GRIZZLY BEARS AND YOU

Whenever you go backpacking during the spring or summer in the west, you run the risk of encountering a wild grizzly in its natural habitat. Recognize that you are, indeed, in its territory, and it is your duty to respect that. Grizzly bears would rather save their energy and not attack, so never come between a mother grizzly and her cubs, and never purposefully walk up to a wild bear. This can trigger an attack and end badly for you. 

Also, never go alone when you go hiking or backpacking. Always have at least one friend accompany you. This guarantees safety in numbers and, if something does go wrong, there is someone else there that can call or go looking for help.
Remember that grizzly bears are wild animals and you’re in their space. They may be more aggressive during the spring since they are looking for food and for mates. Never get in the way of a grizzly and its target and never come between a mother bear and her cubs. Stay safe and enjoy the great outdoors.
